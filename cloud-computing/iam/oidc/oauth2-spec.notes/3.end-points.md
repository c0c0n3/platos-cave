# 3. Protocol Endpoints

Server endpoints:

* **Authorisation**. Process of getting authorisation grant from
  resource owner.
* **Token**. Where client exchanges authorisation grant for an
  access token, typically with client authentication.

Client endpoint:

* **Redirection**. Where authorisation server returns authorisation
  grant to client.

Security considerations:

* Use TLS to secure interaction.
* Ignore empty/unrecognised params.
* Never duplicate params in requests/responses.
* URIs must not include a fragment component.


### 3.1. Authorisation Endpoint

* Authorisation server must verify resource owner's identity.
* The how (e.g. username/password login, session cookies) is beyond scope.
* Must support `GET` and may support `POST`.

#### 3.1.1. Response Type
* Endpoint used for two grant type flows: authorisation code or implicit.
* Client specifies which one with `response_type` param.

#### 3.1.2. Redirection Endpoint
* After authentication/authorisation, authorisation server redirects
  resource owner to endpoint specified during client registration or
  when making authorisation request.
* Redirection URI must be absolute.

###### Registration requirements
* Public and confidential clients using implicit grant must register
  their redirection endpoints.
* Ideally all clients should register their redirection endpoints to
  avoid open redirection attacks---see section 10.15.
* Ideally clients register URI scheme/authority/path and they can only
  change query component dynamically when requesting authorisation.
* Client may register multiple redirection endpoints and use `redirect_uri`
  param to specify the wanted one---see "3.1.2.3. Dynamic Configuration"
  for URI matching rules.


### 3.2. Token Endpoint

* Used in all flows except for implicit grant type.
* Client must `POST` requests.

#### 3.2.1. Client Authentication
Required for confidential clients or clients issued with credentials.
Used for:

* Binding of refresh tokens and authorisation codes to client.
* Recovering from compromised tokens.
* Periodic credential rotation.


### 3.3. Access Token Scope

`scope` parameter is a list of space-delimited, case-sensitive strings
(order is irrelevant), each specifying an access range.

* Client uses it in request to ask for a set of permissions.
* Server uses it in response to specify which perms were granted if
  they're different from requested.
