Foundations
-----------

#### Measure theory
* ch 1 of probability w/ martingales
* ch 14 of way of analysis 

#### Probability
* a modern into to prob & stats for intuition
* probability w/ martingales for rigour, conceptual clarity and abstract
  approach based on measure theory 

#### Learning from data
* [An intro to statistical learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)
  (simplified version of the below)
* [The elements of statistical learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)

#### Machine Learning
* MIT course on the maths of big data with a slant on linear algebra:
  [home](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-ll-005-d4m-signal-processing-on-databases-fall-2012/index.htm),
  [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/mathematics-big-data) 
* MIT intro course on deep learning: [home](http://introtodeeplearning.com/),
