Foundations
-----------

#### Measure theory
* ch 1 of probability w/ martingales
* ch 14 of way of analysis 

#### Probability
* a modern into to prob & stats for intuition
* probability w/ martingales for rigour, conceptual clarity and abstract
  approach based on measure theory 

#### Learning from data
* [An intro to statistical learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)
  (simplified version of the below)
* [The elements of statistical learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)
* [Statistical Learning Theory and Applications](http://www.mit.edu/~9.520/fall18/)
  (MIT graduate-level course; also includes lectures on neural networks and
  deep learning)
